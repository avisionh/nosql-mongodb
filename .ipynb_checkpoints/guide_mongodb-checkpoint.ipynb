    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases, whereas SQL databases are relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas data is stored in a tabular format within SQL databases, this is eschewed in NoSQL databases where the data can be stored in various forms, and in most cases without any structure at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "These databases are designed to handle the processing of dynamically evolving, real-time changing large-scale and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, NoSQL databases are built to be flexible and scalable so that they can hold any type of data at large volumes and with little work in creating a pre-existing structure to hold the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these features, they are ideal of Agile development methods to iteratively building software.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several implementations of NoSQL databases, which are categoried in the following families:\n",
    "1. **Key-value stores** | Every item in the database is stored s a *key* alongside its *value*, as *key-value* pairs. These are the simplest NoSQL databases.\n",
    "1. **Document databases** | These pair each *key* with a complext data structure known as a *document*. *Documents* can contain many different *key-value* pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents. Can be thought of as an extension, higher-functionality version of **key-value stores**. Popular implementation is [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).\n",
    "1. **Wide-column stores** | Designed to store columns of data together, rather than rows. Popular implementation is [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).\n",
    "1. **Graph stores** | Store information about networks that connections between objects. The most obvious example is provided by social networks. Popular implementation is [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/).\n",

    "- You can define your data structure upfront and it is unlikely to change\n",
    "- You want strong data integrity/quality in terms of its accuracy and completeness/comprehensiveness.\n",

    "As an ecommerce giant, you sell a phenomenal range of products (*e.g. books, electronics, clothes and even food*), with each of these products having a number of characteristics associated with them (*e.g. price, weight, dimensions, manufacturer description, reviews*). \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, these products, their product categories and characteristics could all be stored in a relational database such as SQL. However, if a new characteristic such as user reviews were to be added, it may require that the entire database is destroyed and re-designed to incorporate this. With a non-relational database, there is no need to start from scratch - **flexibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given how many orders you collect and process (not to mention that you also monitor customers' activity in browsing and mulling over products), then you are collecting huge reams of data. There will come a point where you have reached their 'computer memory' limit. Under a relational database system which is **vertically-scalable**, this means to increase your 'computer memory', you will need to buy a bigger computer with more storage space, and transfer all that data over - getting rid of the old one. Whereas with a non-relational database system which is **horizontally-scalable**, you only need to buy an extra computer with less memory, add it to the network of other computers. The *total storage space of all these computers* increases thereby taking on the extra data. It's immediately apparent that this is much more cost-effective - **scalability**."
