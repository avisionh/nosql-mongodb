    "### What is this new-fangled No-SQL then?\n",
    "No-SQL is **not** SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "No-SQL belongs to a family of non-relational databases, whereas SQL belongs to the category of relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It refers to a set of databases designed to handle the processing of dynamically evolving, real-time changing large-scale and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, No-SQL databases are built to be flexible and scalable so that they can hold any type of data at large volumes and with little work in creating a pre-existing structure to hold the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Amazon\n",
    "As an ecommerce giant, they sell a phenomenal range of products (*e.g. books, electronics, clothes and even food*), with each of these products having a number of characteristics associated with them (*e.g. price, weight, dimensions, manufacturer description, reviews*). \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, these products, their product categories and characteristics could all be stored in a relational database such as SQL. However, if a new characteristic such as user reviews were to be added, it may require that the entire database is destroyed and re-designed to incorporate this. With a non-relational database, there is no need to start from scratch - **flexibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another compelling example for choosing non-relational databases over relational databases in this example is that given how many orders Amazon collects and processes (not to mention that they also monitor your activity in browsing and mulling over products), then they are collecting huge reams of data. There will come a point where they have reached their 'computer memory' limit. Under a relational database system which is **vertically-scalable**, this means to increase their 'computer memory', they will need to buy a bigger computer with more storage space, and transfer all that data over, getting rid of the old one. Whereas with a non-relational database system which is **horizontally-scalable**, they only need to buy an extra computer with less memory, add it to the network of other computers, and the *total storage space of all these computers* increases thereby taking on the extra data. It's immediately apparent that this is much more cost-effective - **scalability**."
